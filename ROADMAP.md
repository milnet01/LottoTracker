# ROADMAP — LottoTracker

Status keys: 📋 planned · 🚧 in progress · ✅ shipped · 💭 considered

## Core

- ✅ **LOTTO-0001** Parse Standard Bank ticket SMSes and score them against real draws.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: the PC reads your lottery texts and tells you whether any won.
  Spec: `docs/specs/LOTTO-0001-lottery-ticket-tracker.md`.
  Covers both SMS eras, both results sources, Multiplay expansion and prize
  pricing. 558 tickets parsed, 121 checkable (426 predate all draw data, 11
  are in a pool no source publishes); R700.10 found still claimable.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0002** Local web page showing tickets, results and claimable winnings.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: a page in your browser instead of a wall of terminal text.
  Spec: `docs/specs/LOTTO-0002-local-web-page.md`. Blocked by LOTTO-0009.
  Chosen by the user over a desktop app or CLI. Should show live tickets with
  draws remaining, wins with their expiry dates, and a claimable total.
  A local server bound to 127.0.0.1, driven by a PySide6 tray icon that starts
  and stops it and re-opens the page — pattern copied from the user's existing
  `Ants_Projects_Hub_Website/serve.mjs` + `tray/ants-stats-tray.py`, which is
  reused as a shape, not as code (that repo is public and deploys to Pages).
  Spend is compared against winnings over the checkable tickets only.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0009** Score every pool a ticket was entered in, not just the top tier.
  Kind: fix. Source: in-session-2026-08-01 (found while sizing LOTTO-0008).
  Layman: you paid for three lottery draws and we were only checking one of them.
  Spec: `docs/specs/LOTTO-0009-entered-pools.md` (umbrella, covers LOTTO-0008).
  Blocks LOTTO-0002 — the page would otherwise display known-low totals.
  PLUS games cannot be bought alone: the operator's rules require the base game
  and run a separate draw with its own prize pool for each tier
  (LOTTO/PLUS 1/PLUS 2 Rules 21Sep25 §1.5, §1.16, §1.17). `tickets.py::GAME_MAP`
  maps an SMS to one pool, so a `Lotto Plus 2` ticket is scored against
  `lotto/2` alone and its `lotto/0` and `lotto/1` entries are never checked.
  449 of 558 tickets are entered in more than one pool (444 name a PLUS tier,
  5 more are priced as one); 558 of 1,233 paid entries are scored today (45%).
  The printed game name is unreliable — the suffix is sometimes omitted, and
  Standard Bank dropped it entirely after the 2026-06-01 handover — so the
  entered tiers are derived from the ticket price, which resolves 558/558
  exactly once the handover price change is applied. Name is a cross-check.
  Also rescues the 11 `Daily Lotto Plus` tickets now reported as uncheckable:
  no source carries `daily/1`, but their base `daily/0` entry is checkable.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0003** Pick up new tickets automatically as the SMS arrives.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: new tickets appear by themselves, without plugging the phone in.
  KDE Connect emits `conversationCreated` / `conversationUpdated` over D-Bus;
  subscribe rather than polling.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0008** Record what each ticket cost, so prizes can be compared against spend.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: show what you paid for a ticket next to what it won.
  Spec: `docs/specs/LOTTO-0009-entered-pools.md` (umbrella, covers this id).
  Every ticket SMS carries `Played R<amount>`; `tickets.py::parse()` matches it
  and discards it. Capturing it into `Ticket` is the whole change.
  Specified with LOTTO-0009 rather than alone: the price is also the signal for
  which pools a ticket was entered in, so one contract governs both readings.
  Feeds LOTTO-0002's spend-vs-prize display. The comparison must be drawn only
  over checkable tickets: cost is known for all 558, winnings for 121, so a
  lifetime total would convert 437 unknowns into losses.

## Hardening

- 📋 **LOTTO-0004** Automated guard that no SMS content can be committed.
  Kind: security. Source: in-session-2026-08-01.
  Layman: make it impossible to accidentally publish your messages.
  `tools/verify_privacy.py` now does the checking, but someone must remember
  to run it. A pre-commit hook would make it structural.

- 💭 **LOTTO-0005** Support other banks' ticket SMS formats.
  Kind: feature. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: let people at other banks use this too.
  Only `tickets.py::parse()` is bank-specific. Needs a sample message per
  bank; see the "Adding your bank" section of README.md.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0007** Close the cold-eyes deferred tail.
  Kind: review-fix. Source: cold-eyes-2026-08-01 loop 3.
  Layman: a short list of known rough edges, written down so they are not
  rediscovered by another expensive review.
  Verified but unfixed at the loop cap; each has a §11 row in
  `docs/specs/LOTTO-0001-lottery-ticket-tracker.md`:
  (a) an unscrapable payout page prices every archive-era win at R0.00
  instead of raising, unlike `paying_combinations()` which does raise;
  (b) `backfill.py::parse_page()` raises `KeyError` on an abbreviated month
  in a href rather than skipping the row;
  (c) INV-5's grep sees only a double-quoted `"MATCH <digit>` literal — it
  cannot see the label grammar in `api_label()`/`site_label()`, so a
  feed-side rename of `MATCH n` would drop every win silently;
  (d) Multiplay expansion is Lotto-only; a >6-number PowerBall or Daily
  board would silently collapse to one line (no such ticket exists today);
  (e) §8's "~30 lookups a month" is not recomputed from §10's request model.

- 💭 **LOTTO-0006** Backfill results earlier than 2025-01-01.
  Kind: enhancement. Source: in-session-2026-08-01.
  Layman: check really old tickets too.
  Low value: prizes expire after 365 days, so these can no longer be claimed.
  Note the 2025-01-01 floor is a configured default in
  `backfill.build(years=(2025, 2026))`, not a limit of the archive itself.
