# ROADMAP — LottoTracker

Status keys: 📋 planned · 🚧 in progress · ✅ shipped · 💭 considered

## Core

- ✅ **LOTTO-0001** Parse Standard Bank ticket SMSes and score them against real draws.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: the PC reads your lottery texts and tells you whether any won.
  Spec: `docs/specs/LOTTO-0001-lottery-ticket-tracker.md`.
  Covers both SMS eras, both results sources, Multiplay expansion and prize
  pricing. 558 tickets parsed, 121 checkable (426 predate all draw data, 11
  are in a pool no source publishes); R700.10 found still claimable.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0002** Local web page showing tickets, results and claimable winnings.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: a page in your browser instead of a wall of terminal text.
  Chosen by the user over a desktop app or CLI. Should show live tickets with
  draws remaining, wins with their expiry dates, and a claimable total.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0003** Pick up new tickets automatically as the SMS arrives.
  Kind: implement. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: new tickets appear by themselves, without plugging the phone in.
  KDE Connect emits `conversationCreated` / `conversationUpdated` over D-Bus;
  subscribe rather than polling.

## Hardening

- 📋 **LOTTO-0004** Automated guard that no SMS content can be committed.
  Kind: security. Source: in-session-2026-08-01.
  Layman: make it impossible to accidentally publish your messages.
  `tools/verify_privacy.py` now does the checking, but someone must remember
  to run it. A pre-commit hook would make it structural.

- 💭 **LOTTO-0005** Support other banks' ticket SMS formats.
  Kind: feature. Source: user-request-2026-08-01.
  Layman: let people at other banks use this too.
  Only `tickets.py::parse()` is bank-specific. Needs a sample message per
  bank; see the "Adding your bank" section of README.md.

- 📋 **LOTTO-0007** Close the cold-eyes deferred tail.
  Kind: review-fix. Source: cold-eyes-2026-08-01 loop 3.
  Layman: a short list of known rough edges, written down so they are not
  rediscovered by another expensive review.
  Verified but unfixed at the loop cap; each has a §11 row in
  `docs/specs/LOTTO-0001-lottery-ticket-tracker.md`:
  (a) an unscrapable payout page prices every archive-era win at R0.00
  instead of raising, unlike `paying_combinations()` which does raise;
  (b) `backfill.py::parse_page()` raises `KeyError` on an abbreviated month
  in a href rather than skipping the row;
  (c) INV-5's grep sees only a double-quoted `"MATCH <digit>` literal — it
  cannot see the label grammar in `api_label()`/`site_label()`, so a
  feed-side rename of `MATCH n` would drop every win silently;
  (d) Multiplay expansion is Lotto-only; a >6-number PowerBall or Daily
  board would silently collapse to one line (no such ticket exists today);
  (e) §8's "~30 lookups a month" is not recomputed from §10's request model.

- 💭 **LOTTO-0006** Backfill results earlier than 2025-01-01.
  Kind: enhancement. Source: in-session-2026-08-01.
  Layman: check really old tickets too.
  Low value: prizes expire after 365 days, so these can no longer be claimed.
  Note the 2025-01-01 floor is a configured default in
  `backfill.build(years=(2025, 2026))`, not a limit of the archive itself.
